In this project, I am in charge of one of the sub-projects, detail task 1, KAIST. My responsibility is to manage the research progress and outcomes of the groups as well as continuing my own research. Throughout the project, I was able to conduct research and publish papers as a result on various NLP tasks including structural information, multi-hop QA, question generation, numerical representation, and knowledge base.
